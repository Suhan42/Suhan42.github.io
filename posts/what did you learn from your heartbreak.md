  Thank you for leaving. This just shows that you weren't for me. Those who stay are supposed to stay, those who to go are supposed to go. Rejection is a chisel for perfection. *NO* means next opportunity or new options.

 SO, It's not heartbreak, it's heart shape. Nothing can break your heart. Heart is not breakable.

  These experiences that you're going through are shaping your heart for the relationship that will be long lasting. It's fine tuning it, actually, You need to ask yourself the questions that led you to the situation you were in. But always think of it as heart reshaping, heart developing.
